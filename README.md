# Vending Machine and Printing Press

During the pandemic lots of people were looking for books to read but were reluctant to throw their money at large online corporations while shops and libraries were closed. The idea with this program is to print some literary classics with expired copyrights and sell them through vending machines.

In this program I have implemented the following:
1. books
2. vending machines -> stores books for sale
3. printing press -> prints books to sell in the vending machine

The classes are designed as shown below:
